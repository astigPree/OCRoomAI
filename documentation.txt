This documentation provide for the OC ROOM AI, contains all related configurations to set up the applications

+ What this YouTube video to handle the PyAudio and Vosk Module setup 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mga7_8bYpw'
+ Check if the python installed and has a version 3.9 to set up it
+ Open microphone access in Private & Access > Microphone
+ If any error that related to this; use the link:
    - pyaudio-OSError: [Errno -9999] Unanticipated host error 'https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41518905/pyaudio-oserror-errno-9999-unanticipated-host-error'
    - Python doesn't find model in folder 'https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73671972/python-doesnt-find-model-in-folder-at-modelmodel-name-models-model-en-0-2-if'
    - No text seen in vosk model 'https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69696092/vosk-empty-text-outputjava'
+ before using nltk, download the following
    - nltk.download('punkt')
    - nltk.download('words')
    - nltk.download('maxent_ne_chunker')

+ Download the Vosk Model for english and filipino ( 'vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15' & 'vosk-model-tl-ph-generic-0.6' )
+ Outside Libraries;
    - pip install word2number
    - pip install neuralintents
    - pip install PyAudio
    - pip install pyttsx3
    - pip install vosk


This documentation contains the activities of an artificial intelligence

User Activities:
    User Responses;
        1. Ask 'where' is the location of the room
        2. Ask 'who' are the creator of you

    AI Responses;
        1. Tell the information; where it located with pictures and the current teacher inside the room
        2. Tell the information; developers information

Faculty Activities:
    User Responses;
        1. Ask to 'update' the current teachers in the room

    AI Responses;
        1. Update the current teachers the room located

Developer Activities:
    User Responses;
        1. Ask to 'update' maximum loop for recording
        2. Ask to 'update' channel of microphone
        3. Ask to 'update' frame per buffer of analyzing voices

    AI Responses;
        1. Update the current maximum loop for recording
        2. Update the current channel of microphone
        3. Update the current frame per buffer



This documentation contains the algorithm of the applications

1. Check the current command
2. If command stop the continuation of the program, wait till owner permission
3. If none then continue to main activity
4. User, Faculty, Developer enter input by speech
5. Check if the input is in the built-in commands
6. If in the commands then execute it and disregard future activities
7. If not then proceed to identification if 'who' or 'where' using neural_intents models
8. If the input intent is 'where' identify the list of rooms in the input, if not provided ask again ( go back to 1 )
9. If the input intent is 'who' identify again using neural_intents models to identify the input 'who' intent
10. If the input is identified then show the information or the activity that the application identified
11. Wait for a minute before change back to main screen or wait till the User, Faculty, Developer input tru speech
